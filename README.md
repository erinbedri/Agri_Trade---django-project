# AGRI TRADE

## Description:
AgriTrade is a marketplace connecting sellers and buyers of agricultural products. The platform allows registered users to post their products, interact with other users through a messaging system, read blog articles, and like products of other users. The site was built using Django, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Cloudinary, and PostgreSQL. My role in this project was to design and implement the full-stack solution, providing a user-friendly and efficient platform for users to trade agricultural products.
